This is a little word counting program in C++.

It uses a custom tree-like structure to store found words and their number of occurences
with a limited memory footprint.

The project can be open with MonoDevelop (version 5.10 for me) or compiled simply with
`g++ -std=c++17 -O3 -o TopWords main.cpp`
